# FFIV-auto-login
The program will ask for the location of your FFIV launcher and password the first time it's launched, after the initial setup, the program will automatically log in and launch FFIV upon running unless you've changed your password or where your game was stored.

NOTE: Double backslash is required before every subfolder for launcher path, the program will not work otherwise.
